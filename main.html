  <p><h1>OVERVIEW</h1></p>

  <p>
      <h2>Introduction and Objective</h2>
      <h3>​
        ​To simply define, resources are everything available in our environment which satisfies our needs. India is a land rich with both natural as well as human resources. <br>
        Coal and petroleum acts as the major sources for energy generation. With the increasing concern of
         global warming and steady depletion of coal and petroleum resources we need to turn towards more sustainable and green fuels.  ​

        The objective of my research and model on TIDAL ENERGY is as follows: ​<br>
        
        1) To generate huge amount of energy with negligible running cost.​<br>
        
        2)  To move towards more eco-friendly sources of generating electricity and reduce the dependency on coal and petroleum. ​<br>
        
        3) To generate employment in coastal areas (like recruiting people for construction and maintenance and operation).​<br>
        
        4) To contribute towards the Prime Minister’s vision of ‘Aatmanirbhar Bharat’.​<br>

 <h2> Usage:​</h2>
<h3>
My project would be valuable in terms of: -​<br>

1) No ecological side effects of the project.​<br>

2) Low electricity generation cost per unit. ​<br>

3) Very low operational cost due to negligible requirement of man power. ​<br>

4) It is a modular concept in which N-number of segments can be added to get required thrust for alternator. ​<br>

5) Low repairing and maintenance cost. ​<br>

6) It is assembled wit nut and bolts hence easy to transport, install and dismantle.​<br>

<h1><p style="text-align: center; text-decoration: underline;">Research</p></h1>
<br>
<p>
<h2><p style="text-align: center;text-decoration: underline;">Background</p></h2>
<h3>
 <br>
  <p style="text-align: center;">  “We are like tenant farmers, digging up the land around the world for fuel, when we should be using<br>
                            nature’s inexhaustible sources of energy—sun, wind, and tide...”​<br></p>
<br>
 In the recent years there has been an increase concern for the utilization of sustainable energy resources and the same has been introduced in the school syllabus. <br>
  I always thought whether tidal energy could be harnessed in India and whether the favorable conditions for harnessing such energy resource is available. Last year during my visit to Puri,<br>
  I noticed huge waves on the sea shore and the idea struck my mind that if the energy of these waves could be harnessed then a large amount of electricity could be generated which would reduce our dependence on coal and petroleum products.​

  <h2><p style="text-align: center; text-decoration: underline;">Statement of problem</p></h2><br>
 <h3>
  Upon my further research I found that according to the estimates of the Indian government, 
  the country has a potential of 8,000 MW of tidal energy. This includes about 7,000 MW in the Gulf of Cambay
  in Gujarat, 1,200 MW in the Gulf of Kutch and 800 MW in the Gangetic delta in the Sunder bans region of
  West Bengal and geographically I noticed that Puri lies near the Utkal Plains, coastal plains in eastern
  Odisha state, and the plains are bounded by the Lower Ganges (Ganga) Plain to the north, the Bay of Bengal
  on the east, the Tamil Nadu Plains to the south, and the Eastern Ghats to the west.​<br>​
  </h3>
<br>

<h3>
  Such location has enough possibility for the construction of a tidal energy harnessing plant but sadly due to lack of idea and innovation, lack of initiative and ignorance of such sustainable energy resources due to high availability of electricity and energy from coal and petroleum products overlooked the possibility of building such plants. This is the data about share of energy produced in India by different sources.​

<h3> From the above data and pie chart we can conclude that India is dependent on coal and petroleum products to a large extent for meeting its energy requirements. Such rising coal imports and usage not only affect our country's economy but also the environment by increasing pollution which in turn causes various air borne diseases like Asthma, Chronic Bronchitis, Lung Cancer and others. Therefore, we must move towards the alternative renewable and clean sources of energy like the tidal energy.​

<h2><p style="text-align: center; text-decoration: underline;">Analysis</p></h2>
<br>
<h3>
  <p>
    1) Present methods of tackling the problem:​

At present no such remarkable projects have been undertaken in India but there are other models of Tidal Energy harnessing plants around the world although they have a lot of disadvantages including high construction costs and large amount of electro-magnetic emissions which are harmful for the marine life.​
<br>
 2)  Proposed solution:​

The tidal energy harnessing system as discussed in this abstract could prove to be a turning stone and a significant step towards the utilization of the abundant sustainable resources available.​
 <br>
 3)  Alternate solution /approaches:​

 In the recent years the government has also taken various steps in this direction like The Gujarat government will be developing India’s first tidal energy plant and the state government has approved Rs 25 crore for setting up the 50 MW plant at the Gulf of Kutch but the project is still under hold.​
 <br>
 4)  Novelty of approach:​
 
 My approach can be considered better because there is only one-time investment in the project. Secondly it has a massive capacity of producing electricity and finally it is suitable for most of the coasts of India and does not have any harmful effects on the aquatic eco-system.​

    <h3>
  Description of concepts, theories and/or approach involved in the proposed solution:​
<br>
Concept:​
<br>
 Wave caught through multiple segment propeller to rotate the alternator for generation of electricity.​
<br>
Theory: ​
<br>
  Energy is the quantitative property that must be transferred to an object in order to perform work. According to the principal of conservation of energy; Energy can neither be create nor destroyed; it can only be transformed from one form to other. In this case the mechanical energy of the sea waves is converted into electrical energy through an alternator.

<br>
<h2><p style="text-align: center; text-decoration: underline;">Description of the flow of operations demonstrating key features and functionality</p></h2><br>
<h3>
a) Wave height will be considered for designing the system and accordingly the system’s height shall be designed and it would be based on the various wave heights as per survey report. Wave period shall be 24x7x365 days or you can say throughout the year all time.​
<br>
b) The fixed structure mentioned in the schematic is a space frame that supports the shaft at many places. At the end of every propeller shaft there is a shaft support with roller bearing. Span of the support may be in between 10 to 20 meter which implies that the support distance depends on the length of the propeller or propeller shaft length.    (Refer FIG-4).
<br>
c)Structure slope is adjustable based on requirement. It can vary in between 5 degree to 30 degree approx. and is needed to be finalized in such a way that the slope propeller can get maximum thrust. The shore side of the structure end will be hinged type and the sea side will be adjustable slope fixing support.​
<br>
d) Design of such space frame to withstand wave forces will be challenging and has been taken into account in my design.​
<br>
e)  All turbine wheels shall rotate at same speed because all turbine shafts are mechanically coupled with each other as well as with generator gear box.​

<h2><p style="text-align: center; text-decoration: underline;">Performance estimate of the solution</p></h2><br>
<h3>
a) A mechanical load test has to be performed instead of placing alternator along with gear box and as per mechanical load test report; we need to decide alternator size along with MW rating. Weight and speed of the mechanical load is the key factor for further decision making and to reduce the weight of the assembly, Aluminum component to be used where ever possible for example shaft, propeller etc.​
<br>
I) Approximate weight of space frame per segment = 4 tones​
<br>
II) Approximate weight of propeller and shaft=0.4 tones​
<br>
III) Approximate weight of alternator with all components (like gear box) =3 tones​
<br>
<br>
b) Turbine wheel shall face two side waves. One is front wave and another is return water wave. Front wave height is very high compare to return wave. So, radius of the turbine wheel shall be from shaft to return wave height.​
<br>
I) The height/radius of the turbine wheel=1 to 2.5 meter​
<br>
II) The length of the shaft= 5-10 meter​
<br>
III) The expected energy generated would be 50 MW for 200-meter width of one

    <h2><p style="text-align:center; text-decoration: underline;">Result</p></h2><br>
    <h3> 
      Pros and Cons of your solution:​<br><br>

Pros:​<br><br>

  1. Extremely low cost of electricity per unit which is beneficial for the consumer as the below graph depicts the average electricity cost per kilowatt hour. It is clearly evident that this amount is continuously increasing and was calculated as Rs. 6.09 per kilowatt hour in the fiscal year 2019. This amount can be reduced by harnessing the seamless tidal energy .​​<br>
  <div class="image_1"><img src="808201.png"></div><br>
  2. Negligible pollution and eco-friendly.​
<br>
  3. Electricity can be made available 24X7 unlike solar energy which can be used only during the daytime.​
   <br> 
  4. It will act as a source of endless power as tides depend on the gravitational attraction of the sun and moon, which is not going to end anytime soon.​
  <br>  
  5. It has low construction cost and is only one-time investment.​
  <br><br>  
  Cons:​
   <br> <br>
  1. Power may vary from high to low due to variation in the intensity of tides.​
    <br>
  2. Synchronizing speed of the alternator cannot be kept constant due to variation in tides.​
    <br>
  3. AC power cannot be directly generated due to variation in synchronizing speed.​
    <br>
  4. Not resistant to natural calamities like Cyclone and Typhoon.​
